        Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than 
        <span style="color: #ff0000">software development.</span>
        Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; 
        <span style="color: #0000a0">however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ever-increasingly</span>  important.</span>

      <p style="background-color: #663892;">A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.</p>
